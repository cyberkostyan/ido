The first(?) Initial Development Offerring

## What is it?

Hopefully an efficient way to fund development in a case when you have a little initial capital. 

Unlike in ICO, the initial funds are not spent on marketing (can be hundreds and sometimes millions of dollars). Instead the crypto currency is locked in a smart contract as a reserve.

The same amount of ERC20 tokens is issued as the money in smart contract reserve.

However, only a small % of the tokens is assigned to investor (let's say 10% initially), the rest of the tokens (e.g. 90%) is sitting inside the smart contract, and founders decide who to assign these tokens.

Now the project needs contributors, marketing people, etc. Instead of paying contributors in fiat or crypto, the founder of the project may be paying in tokens that he controls. The contributors are guaranteed to exchange these tokens into crypto (ETH) with a 1:1 ratio.

Now the tokens can be exchanged into crypto (in case of ethereum - ETH) at any time with a 1:1 ratio. But if the contributors believe in the succes of the project they will likely choose to keep them. Or sell them on exchange.

If it is a project with hight expectancy of success, and these tokens are believed to be exchange into project's coins, there will be much more non-contributing community people willing to buy the tokens from developers at a premium.

When the token is exchanged back to crypto using the smart contract reserves, the crypto is sent to holder of tokens, and tokens are burnt. When 50% of crypto (ETH) reserves is burnt a next investment round kicks in automatically at a rate set by founders (that optionally can be set at any time, and could theoretically match market price of the token). At this point ETH is automatically converted to tokens at osme rate (let's say 20:1, meaning for every 20 ETH investor gets 1 token and 19 tokens stay within contract for founders to pay contributors).

It may so happen that the tokens never hit reserves in the smart contract, and there is always a demand for tokens that is greater than 1:1. in this case the project is complete totally with very little money of founders or their friends, which is returned after project is complete.

## Summary

This approach to funding ensures that there is no overraise that many people witnessed with ICOs. This method also gives more power over project to the contributors - the people who create it. There is no overspent on marketing, pr and other bs that the current ICO craze has created.
